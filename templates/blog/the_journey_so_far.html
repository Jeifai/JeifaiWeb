               <br>
               <p>It might sounds obvious but let's repeat it: 2020 has been an unusual year from too many points of view.</p>
               <p>Without taking into account the dramatic events occoured with the global pandemic emergency, Jeifai's develop has been an incredible rollercoaster till now.</p>
               <p>The idea to start this project has came so naturally that from one day to another, the team was diving into coding at a pace never knew before.</p>
               <p>As a proper rollercoaster would do, this year has fluctuated across moments of slow speed into moments at speed of lights.</p>
               <p>Sometimes ideas were flourishing so fast, that was necessary to completely stop any development in order to figure them out properly.</p>
               <p>An enourmous part of the work has been done, but now the rollearcoasted is facing new challenges.</p>
               <p>Exciting times ahead!</p>

               <h3>Technologies</h3>
               <br>
               <p>We are here to talk about technolgies.</p>
               <p>Developing Jeifai has required to learn an amount of new tech stuff not predicatable at the beginning, and it has been a really beautiful journey.</p>
               <p>First of all, the whole backend is written in Golang. The idea was to try something new, more solid than the standalone Python or Ruby.</p>
               <p>It as been a fantastic idea, because thanks to Golang new levels of understanding have been reached, mostly from an architectural point of view.</p>
               <p>Developing a medium size web application requires a good amount of pattern, and Golang has revelead as an optimal choice because its flexibility.</p>
               <p>Then it came the frontend, and there has been a pretty long debate about which framework start to use.</p>
               <p>VueJS has won the challenge, because of its freshness and low entry level barriers. Vue is a pure pleasure to use, particularry in moving data across different sections of the application.</p>
               <p>Both Goalng and Vue have required to learn new paradingms, syntaks, and of course, a plently of libraries.</p>
               <p>In terms of hosting, Google Cloud has been explored as never before. App Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Database, Billing, Scheduling and so on and sofort. Such a pleasure working with GCP!</p>
               <p>From a database point of view, Postgresql was the choice without any doubts.</p>
               <p>If until now the team was fully capable of extracting data, Jeifai has requeted to write a large amount of queries to insert data, a really valuable experience.</p>
               <p>Deploying a business intelligence software, another huge challenge, not as big as ensuring safety with HTTPS. So many pages of documentations have been explored!</p>
               <p>Of course, moder softare requires modern pipelines, so jeifai is also driven by cotnuous Integration metodologies, making new deploies always available and ready to go with a minimum effort.</p>
