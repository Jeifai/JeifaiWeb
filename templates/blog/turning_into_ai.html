               <h3>A clear direction</h3>
               <br>
               <p>Any modern startup capable of generating data has as mandatory scenario the introduction of artifical intelligence (AI) dynamics within the business model.</p>
               <p>Moreover, a determining factor behind the success of a startup is the ability to develop unique technologies, not easily replicable.</p>
               <p>Until now Jeifai has not been able yet to develop distance between potential competitors, but with AI the gap can be generated.</p>
               <p>Due to the nature of the data available to Jeifai, it is possibile to start speculating in creating predictive models.</p>
               <p>AI will allow Jeifai to offer "even more" cutting edge insights to its customers.</p>

            <h3>Why this is possibile</h3>
            <br>
            <p>One of the key decision taken by Jeifai since the beginning has been to avoid integrating too many data sources.
               More sparse and variagated is the information, more difficult is to have a deep knowledge about it.
            </p>
            <p>In other words, if "the total amount of columns of your Excel file" is limited, in a short time you can fully master it.</p>
            <p>Concentrating energies into the data already available is a bold strategical decision.</p>
            <p>Despite this, the amount of data generated by Jeifai grows <a href="https://jeifai.com/data" target="_blank">steadily on a daily basis</a>.</p>
            <div>
               <h3>Necessity of a step back</h3>
               <br>
               <p>The decision of moving into machine learning (ML) comes with a cost.</p>
               <p>At the moment nobody in the team has the skills to develop a good quality ML model.
                  This implies the necessity to stop developing Jeifai as a whole, in order to learn the technical skills required by AI.
               </p>
               <p>It is a learning journey which will take weeks (rough estimation of 2/3 months) in order to start providing the first proper results.</p>
               <p>After this learning stage, it will be possibile to start implementing ML tecniques using Jeifai's data.</p>
            </div>

               <h3>An AI first company</h3>
               <br>

                     Fig 2 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWLcyFtni6U" target="_blank">Google CEO Sundar Pichaiâ€™s I/O 2017 keynote</a>

               </figure>
               <p>Google till 2015 has been a "mobile first" company, deciding then to become an "AI first company".</p>
               <p>What this clearly tells is that the future belongs to companies able to embrace AI as core foundation of their technological DNA.</p>
               <p>For Jeifai this is an enormous opportunity, because our early stage size allows us the flexibility to fully grasp this AI attitude.</p>
               <p>Despite the enourmous quanity of work required, being an AI first company will lead to long terms benefits not easily predicatble on this point of time.</p>
               <p>So following Google's way, <b>Jeifai is from now on officially an AI first company</b>.

               <h3>What's next</h3>
               <br>
               <p>As previously mentioned, this new apporach requires a lot of preliminary study, but this is just a matter of hard work and dedication.</p>
               <p>Data is needed, so it is really important to keep extracting fresh information every day, potentially adding more and more companies.</p>
               <p>We know that good things need time, so with patience we are going to figure it out the best AI strategy for Jeifai.</p>

               <h3>A last note</h3>
               <br>
               <p>Did you noticed that the name Jeifai....already contains the letters AI?</p>
               <p>Believe it ot not, this was not planned! Crazy, isn't?</p>
