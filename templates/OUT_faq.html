            </strong>
            <p>
                It depends by the size of the company, usually bigger the company, bigger the complexity, but it is not always the case.

                What about your technology?
            </strong>
            <p>
                We have a proprietary software which is running using latest cloud technologies. At the beginning this decision was not optimal, because it has required
                us to slow down our developing processes due to the necessity to learn new things, but we are sure in the long run it will pay off its dividends. 
                We have total control, strong felxibility and ability to scale. Any decision we take has simplicity and maintenability as priority. 
                As soon as things get too complex, we try to look things from different angles.

                Are the information you provide accurate?
            </strong>
            <p>
                As data aggregator, we collect information from multiple sources into one place.
                Those data are stored in different ways, allowing us to prove without any doubt from where a certain information comes from.
                Moreover, we have designed our database to be as lean as possibile, avoiding redundancies, allowing readable queries.

                At the moment our platform does not allow you to export data.
                However, under specific request, we might consider exporting data for you occasionally.
